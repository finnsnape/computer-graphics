# RedNoise
## Status
- W6T7 (completeq)
## Todo
- Fix x orbit
- Fix ray tracing orbit (need to utilise orientation)
- Ensure we are translating correctly
- Add comments
- Figure out global WIDTH, HEIGHT
- Potentially split into more classes
- Try fix event being missed (CTRL+C sometimes won't exit)
- Fix rounding errors and type warnings
- Check our depth buffer is x by y and not y by x
- Separate what's required (e.g., not all types of camera need a depth buffer)
