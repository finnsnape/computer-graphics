# RedNoise
## Status
- W7T4 (in progress)
## Main tasks
- Specular lighting
- Fix lookAt
- Export of image files and creation of animated video
- Mirrors
- Test on vagrant
## General
- Try moving model (or part of model, e.g., just one box!)
- Add comments
- Potentially split into more classes
- Fix rounding errors and type warnings
- Reduce duplicate functions (e.g., transposing)
- Improve function names
- Potentially add own implementations of trivial functions (rotate, perspective)
- Consider texture mapping
- Fix proximity lighting to work when light is very close to intersection
- Find way to use perspective logic in our demo
- Remove unused imports

## Notes
- negative z is away from us
- a * b in glm is same as a * b in maths (for matrices)
